# all-in-one

You can place all your markdown slides in a single file like this one.

--

## Verticle slides

Add vertical slides to your presentation by adding a `--` horizontal rule with an empty line above and below it like this:

```md
# Parent Slide

This is the first slide.

--

# Child Slide

This is the second slide.
```

## Horizontal slides

You can also add horizontal slides by adding `---` horizontal rule with an empty line above and below it like this:

```md
# Slide A

This is the first slide.

---

# Slide B

This is the second slide.
```

# See?

We're are still using the same markdown file but we have two slides now.
