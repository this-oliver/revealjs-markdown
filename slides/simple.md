## Simple

This is a basic template for a reveal.js presentation that uses markdown. All you have to do is edit the markdown files in the '***slides***' folder and update the '***slides/index.html***' file accordingly.

### Step 1. Adding slides

First, you create a new markdown file '***example.md***' in the '***slides***' folder.

--


### Step 2. Updating the slides/index.html file

Add the file name to the '***index.md***' file in the '***slides***' folder. 

```md
<!-- in slides/index.md (note: the numbers matter!!!)-->
1. simple.md
2. images.md
3. audio.md
4. code.md
5. tables.md
6. all-in-one.md
7. example.md
```

--

### Keep in mind

The number in front of the file name **determine the order of the slides** in the presentation. That means you can easily re-order your slides by changing the order of the list items.

```md
<!-- in slides/index.md-->
1. first-file.md
3. third-file.md
2. second-file.md
```
