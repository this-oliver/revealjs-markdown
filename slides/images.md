## Images

<img src="/assets/images/test.png" width="100" height="100" alt="test image">

This slide uses an '`<img>`' element to display an image. To add an image to a slide, save it in the '`assets/images`' folder and add the following snippet to your markdown file:

```html
<!-- do not change '/assets/images/' unless you know what you are doing -->
<img src="/assets/images/<filename>.png" width="200" height="auto" alt="test image">
```

You can also add images using the standard markdown syntax but it is not recommended because it does not allow you to specify the image size:

```md
![test image](/assets/images/test.png)
```

<sup>Don't believe me? Scroll down and see for yourself &darr;</sup>

![test image](/assets/images/test.png)
